# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
** Modeling of bone formation and resorption mediated by parathyroid hormone: response to estrogen/PTH therapy. **   
Rattanakul C, Lenbury Y, Krishnamara N, Wollkind DJ. _Biosystems_
2003:70(1):55-72. [12753937](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12753937),  
**Abstract:**   
Bone, a major reservoir of body calcium, is under the hormonal control of the
parathyroid hormone (PTH). Several aspects of its growth, turnover, and
mechanism, occur in the absence of gonadal hormones. Sex steroids such as
estrogen, nonetheless, play an important role in bone physiology, and are
extremely essential to maintain bone balance in adults. In order to provide a
basis for understanding the underlying mechanisms of bone remodeling as it is
mediated by PTH, we propose here a mathematical model of the process. The
nonlinear system model is then utilized to study the temporal effect of PTH as
well as the action of estrogen replacement therapy on bone turnover. Analysis
of the model is done on the assumption, supported by reported clinical
evidence, that the process is characterized by highly diversified dynamics,
which warrants the use of singular perturbation arguments. The model is shown
to exhibit limit cycle behavior, which can develop into chaotic dynamics for
certain ranges of the system's parametric values. Effects of estrogen and PTH
administrations are then investigated by extending on the core model. Analysis
of the model seems to indicate that the paradoxical observation that
intermittent PTH administration causes net bone deposition while continuous
administration causes net bone loss, and certain other reported phenomena may
be attributed to the highly diversified dynamics which characterizes this
nonlinear remodeling process.
